<p>I've always been searching for a way to preserve those fleeting moments in daily life—sunrises and sunsets, sudden rainbows, or a friend's offhand remark. For me, becoming a media creator is about keeping memories that many overlook, transforming them into works that can be revisited. <br>
This is my “digital memory box.” My creative mediums include photographs and short videos, capturing moments from life. The tools I often use are CapCut, Procreate, and social media. My goal is for viewers to resonate with these pieces or find their own fleeting memories while browsing through them.</p>
