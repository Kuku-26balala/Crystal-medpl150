<h2 align="center">Week 2 – Reading Susan Sontag’s “Plato’s Cave”</h2>

<hr>

<p>
Reading Susan Sontag’s <em>“Plato's Cave”</em> has made me reconsider why I take photographs and create images. Sontag contends that pictures do not just document reality—they shape it, presenting shadows that may be mistaken for truth. She describes people living in Plato's cave, gazing at shadows and mistaking them for reality. This mirrors our lives today, where cameras are ubiquitous and images continue to flow, shaping our perception of the world. Moreover, the act of creating images influences our relationship with the world.

<p>
For me, photography is not merely about capturing a moment; it is also about selecting what deserves attention. Each photograph highlights certain details while overlooking others. Sontag pointed out that pictures appear “objective” and “real,” but in reality, they are only selective records of reality. In today's media world, we receive a variety of images online every day, which dominate our attention and sometimes cause us to overlook things that deserve serious attention. Images can be misleading; a single frame cannot capture the entire scene, while too many images fail to highlight the point.
</p>

<p>
This has led me to seriously consider how to apply photography and design in my practice. Sontag also argued that photography can become a form of possession—a way to freeze and control the world. By capturing the world through a camera and turning it into an image, it can be controlled. Through designed compositions, one can distort images and guide people's attention. I agree with this concern, but I also see the potential images offer for awareness and understanding.

<p>
Through photography, I can capture fleeting scenes from daily life, transforming ordinary details into visual narratives. Sontag also emphasized photography's limitations: images can provide evidence but not a complete understanding. Thus, I aim to integrate illustration and text to enrich the visual experience. For example, an image may capture a detail, but when paired with illustrations or text, it can spark deeper reflection. In upcoming projects, I will explore how these three elements connect, hoping this semester's portfolio will reveal how I view the world.

<p>
Another perspective that resonates with me is Sontag's notion of photography's ritualistic quality. People take photos to prove they were there, to assure themselves that a moment truly occurred. I realize this in my daily life, but I want my work to be more than proof—I want it to communicate a perspective, an emotion, or a question in life.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, Sontag's article made me understand the importance and responsibility of image creation. The camera is both a tool for recording and a means of shaping viewers' memories and feelings. Images cannot capture everything, but they can capture the real feelings of living in the moment. Whenever I look through my photo album, I recall the scenes from back then. Photos have the power to evoke memories. Photographs are like shadows in Plato's cave, and I hope people see not just the surface of the world, but also the stories and feelings behind it.

<h2 align="center">Week 4 – Reading Nesrine Malik’s “AI Slop”</h2>

<hr>

<p>
After reading Nesrine Malik’s piece on <em>“AI slop,”</em> I became uncomfortable with how far we can slide into a new reality without even noticing. Malik employs “AI slop” to mean the gigantic volume of fakes or AI-produced content—text, image, and videos—that crowd the internet. What caught my attention is that she doesn’t point fingers at technology alone, but at how humans have readily accepted this new normal. Her point is that we are slowly losing the ability to discern what is true and what is not, and we are not even aware that we are losing that ability. It put me into a mode to reflect on how far-reaching technology has become in determining what we see and believe.
</p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 20px 0;">

<p>
I agree with Malik that the risk of AI content is not something showy or obvious. It spreads insidiously and becomes incorporated into what we see daily. This led me to reflect on how frequently I scroll through social media without noticing where things originate. Lots of posts seem true even when they aren’t, and I find that regularly, I no longer question them. Over time, this can lead to individuals no longer bothering with what is true. The issue is not just fake information, but also the sense that fact no longer matters. 
</p>

<p>
After reading the piece, I began noticing how frequently I believe things on the web without considering them. I also became aware that I, too, regularly share pieces too hastily, not verifying them if they are true, indicating just how simple it is to spread “AI slop” unintentionally. I began to consider how regular exposure might influence creativity, too—if individuals are too dependent upon AI content, will we lose inspiration to create things?
</p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 20px 0;">

<p>
Another aspect that caught my attention was Malik’s concept of responsibility. She states that certain companies persist in promoting AI tools even with their knowledge that there are risks, and governments have not acted sufficiently to rein them in. Yet she also reminds us that ordinary citizens bear a portion of that responsibility. Our propensity for wanting quick, simple content facilitates the system perpetuating itself. Prior to her article, I had not paid too much attention to the way that convenience plays a role in the problem. Malik contends that in order to resist this “AI slop,” we must become more mindful, become less rapid, and question what we behold online. Her article reminded me that thinking slowly before believing is a tiny yet significant way to safeguard that which is true.
</p>

<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 20px 0;">

<p>
In conclusion, I learned from Malik’s article that AI itself is not the real problem—it’s how people use it and how easily we let it take our attention. The internet was a more creative and human experience in the past, yet nowadays, it is often full of repeated machine sameness. Malik’s caution is compelling not because it is about a distant future—it is about what is already true today. Her message enlightened me that caution, mindfulness, and attention are the ultimate methods that will always permit me to be real amidst a world full of fake things. Reading her article has also prompted me to reflect on my own habits: I need to be more careful about what I read and share online, and strive to generate more original ideas rather than over-relying on AI-generated content.

<h2 align="center">Week 8 – Reading “Tetteh: The Prisoner ‘My Punishment’”</h2>

<hr>

<p>
These stories deeply moved me, and I felt very sad for Tetteh when I read hers. She was abused by her husband while pregnant. In an argument, she accidentally killed him and was imprisoned. I had seen many news reports about domestic violence online, and these illustrations truly helped me understand her feelings. The illustrations conveyed an atmosphere of fear and loneliness in ways that words cannot express.
</p>

<p>
At first, one of the illustrations that struck me as clever was the image of her husband's smiling face below Tetteh's line, "I was happy to marry him." But on the next page, his expression turned angry, the background became a furious red, and the words "But things soon changed" were written above. At this point, I roughly understood what had happened; even without reading further, I could feel her disappointment and fear. As I expected, Tetteh was subjected to violence by her husband after that. The illustration shows Tetteh sitting in the corner, with her husband's hand about to hit her, which made me feel her helplessness and fear. However, the next scene shows her peeling potatoes with a knife, her husband's hand reaching for her from behind. The lighting in this scene creates an eerie atmosphere, making me tense. And then Tetteh accidentally kills her husband in self-defense.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, I noticed that Tetteh's clothing colors also relate to the story. Before she went to prison, she wore dark green. Green may represent a sense of calm, indicating that she is living a normal life, even though she is experiencing problems at home. However, after entering prison, she wore a red plaid skirt. In contrast to green, red evoked a sense of danger, fear, and intense emotion in me. This also makes her stand out in the illustrations, with vibrant colors. It suggests her life has completely changed. Therefore, the change in color helps readers see the difference between her life before and after prison.
</p>

<p>
Visually, these illustrations are emotional and symbolic. They show not only what happened, but how it felt. Photographs capture facts, not feelings. For example, when she faced danger or fear, the colors are dark and heavy, and the expressions are pained or sad. When she thinks of her baby, her expressions are happy and calm. These illustrations and words let me feel her emotions and situation. If the story used photographs, it might only show real events or places, not her feelings or memories. Illustrations can show what happened and how she felt at that time. For example, one illustration shows her in prison, recalling her husband's death, feeling his ghost watching her. I can understand her fear and guilt. But I was so happy for her courage; in the end, she successfully gave birth to her son, and the illustration shows her smile.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the illustrations, I saw Tetteh's real photograph. She became a social worker, helping women in prison. This made the story feel realistic, showing who she is and helping us understand the real person behind the story. Reading Tetteh's story with illustrations helped me understand her more deeply. The colors, shadows, and spaces all contributed to telling her story. Also, the video at the end featured social workers and activists discussing women in prison. This part felt different from the illustrations. The video presents real faces and voices, connecting the illustrations to real life and providing truth and reality. Their words make the story more powerful because they show that this issue is still happening today.
