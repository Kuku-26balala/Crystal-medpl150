<h2 align="center">Week 2 – Reading Susan Sontag’s “Plato’s Cave”</h2>

<hr>

<p>
Reading Susan Sontag’s <em>“Plato's Cave”</em> made me reconsider why I take photographs and create images. Sontag contends that pictures do not just document reality—they shape it, presenting shadows that may be mistaken for truth. This mirrors our lives today, where cameras are ubiquitous and images continue to flow, shaping our perception of the world.

<p>
For me, photography is not merely about capturing a moment; it is also about selecting what deserves attention. Each photograph highlights certain details while overlooking others. Sontag pointed out that pictures appear “objective” and “real,” but in reality, they are only selective records of reality. 
</p>

<p>
Through photography, I can capture fleeting scenes from daily life, transforming ordinary details into visual narratives. Sontag also emphasized photography's limitations: images can provide evidence but not a complete understanding.
</p>

<p>
Another perspective that resonates with me is Sontag's notion of photography's ritualistic quality. People take photos to prove they were there, to assure themselves that a moment truly occurred. 
</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>  
Sontag's article made me understand the importance and responsibility of image creation. The camera is both a tool for recording and a means of shaping viewers' memories and feelings.
