<b>Reading Susan Sontag‚Äôs <em>‚ÄúPlato's Cave‚Äù</em></b> has made me reconsider why I take photographs and create images. Sontag contends that pictures do not just document reality‚Äîthey shape it, presenting shadows that may be mistaken for truth. She describes people living in Plato's cave, gazing at shadows and mistaking them for reality. This mirrors our lives today, where cameras are ubiquitous and images continue to flow, shaping our perception of the world. Moreover, the act of creating images influences our relationship with the world.

For me, photography is not merely about capturing a moment; it is also about <b>selecting what deserves attention</b>. Each photograph highlights certain details while overlooking others. Sontag pointed out that pictures appear ‚Äúobjective‚Äù and ‚Äúreal,‚Äù but in reality, they are only selective records of reality. In today's media world, we receive a variety of images online every day, which dominate our attention and sometimes cause us to overlook things that deserve serious attention. Images can be misleading; a single frame cannot capture the entire scene, while too many images fail to highlight the point.

This has led me to seriously consider how to apply photography and design in my practice. Sontag also argued that photography can become a form of possession‚Äîa way to freeze and control the world. By capturing the world through a camera and turning it into an image, it can be controlled. Through designed compositions, one can distort images and guide people's attention. I agree with this concern, but I also see the potential images offer for awareness and understanding.

Through photography, I can capture fleeting scenes from daily life, transforming ordinary details into visual narratives. Sontag also emphasized photography's limitations: images can provide evidence but not a complete understanding. Thus, I aim to integrate illustration and text to enrich the visual experience. For example, an image may capture a detail, but when paired with illustrations or text, it can spark deeper reflection. In upcoming projects, I will explore how these three elements connect, hoping this semester's portfolio will reveal how I view the world.

<p>
Another perspective that resonates with me is Sontag's notion of photography's ritualistic quality. People take photos to prove they were there, to assure themselves that a moment truly occurred. I realize this in my daily life, but I want my work to be more than proof‚ÄîI want it to communicate a perspective, an emotion, or a question in life.

<p>
<b>In conclusion</b>, Sontag's article made me understand the importance and responsibility of image creation. The camera is both a tool for recording and a means of shaping viewers' memories and feelings. Images cannot capture everything, but they can capture the real feelings of living in the moment. Whenever I look through my photo album, I recall the scenes from back then. Photos have the power to evoke memories. Photographs are like shadows in Plato's cave, and I hope people see not just the surface of the world, but also the stories and feelings behind it.
