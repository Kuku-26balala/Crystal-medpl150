  <p>
    This image is about ocean pollution and how garbage affects sea animals. 
    The main subject is a turtle wearing a chip bag as a hat. It holds a trash bag in one hand and a plastic cup in the other, showing how waste has become part of its life. 
    I wanted the scene to look funny but also ironic, to show how strange the ocean has become because of human trash. 
    Around the turtle, there is a crab, a fish, a full trash bin, and plastic bottles to make the sea look messy and polluted.

    I used several free online images and combined them with masking to make everything fit together. 
    For the trash bag, I used the ‚ÄúMultiply‚Äù blending mode so it could mix naturally with the background water. 
    For the plastic cup, I drew something on it to make it more fun, and I used ‚ÄúPin Light‚Äù to make it natural. 
    These blending modes helped the objects look more realistic and connected to the underwater world.
