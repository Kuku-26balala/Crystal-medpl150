    This image shows how I feel about time and pressure in daily life. 
    The person in the picture is me, running on a keyboard instead of a road. This means I am always busy with my keyboard. 
    The “sun” in the sky is a clock, showing that I’m always chasing time. 
    There are app icons like Calendar, Email, WhatsApp, and Reminders around me, which represent all the things I need to do every day. 
    The flying books show my goals and studies that I try to keep up with.
  </p>

  <p>
    The running figure is my own photo. I used screenshots from my phone and some free online images. 
    I used masking to replace the road with a keyboard and to blend all the elements. 
    The flying books use the “Multiply” blending mode so they look like part of the sky. 
    This project shows how our lives are mixed with technology and how we often feel like we are always running out of time.
